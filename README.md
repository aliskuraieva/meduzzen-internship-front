An Angular app built using the Angular CLI.

1. Clone the repository.

2. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and configure the environment variables.

3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

4. Install dotenv for managing environment variables.

5. Create a structured file system (components, services, models, etc.).

6. Set up `.gitignore` to avoid pushing unnecessary files.

7. Use semantic HTML tags like <header>, <main>, and <footer> in your templates.
